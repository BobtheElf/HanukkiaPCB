# HanukkiaPCB
This is a PCB I designed on Eagle for my family and all of the good people at Mines Hillel. All of this is free to use and I encourage better designs. I used AutoCad Eagle to design the schematic and PCB, but if you would like to print the board as-is, I have included the most current gerber files.

## More Details
This circuit is based off Dr. Chris Coulston's VU-meter circuit, and should only need a 5V USB-C power source to work. Simply plug in the board with appropriate parts soldered, and turn the potentiometer to the correct day of Hanukkah. Beware that different batches of LM324 op-amps can misbehave in this circuit.
